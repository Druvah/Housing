# Housing - Bridge fights

This plugin was developed in response to a request from a friend who operates a ranked Bedwars server. They wanted a housing system similar to the one found in Dewier's housing.

# Features
- Multiple platforms supported
- Data saving
- Lightweight

# Setup
- "/housing setspawn <name>" - Sets the spawn for the housing platform.
- "/housing setbridge <name>" - Sets the bridge for the housing platform.

PS: If this gets 10 stars i'll add a scoreboard system like dewier's housing.
